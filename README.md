# Bobu Countdown

24 hour countdown made for BoFi I made in 2 hours. (Mentioning the 2 hours so you don't judge the spaghetti too hard.)

Not meant to be used and will likely be abandoned.

## TODO (if it's wanted later)

- [ ] Refactor `canvas.js` into TS
  - [ ] BUG: Fix fireflies resizing on browser resize
- [ ] Make timer editable, along with other features (play, pause, etc.)
- [ ] Resize elements for other screen sizes
- [ ] Make Bobu alarm sound like One Piece's Den Den Mushi
